### SpyType Tracker: Keystrokes Capturing

The SpyType Tracker is a Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to capture and record keystrokes made by the user. It provides an easy-to-use interface for starting and stopping the keylogging process and offers the option to save the captured keystrokes to a file for further analysis or entertainment purposes.

   ```

### Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies and run the program, follow these steps to use the SpyType Tracker:

1. **Login as Admin**: Click the "Login as Admin" button and enter the admin password when prompted.

2. **Start Keylogger**: After successfully logging in as admin, click the "Start Keylogger" button to initiate the keylogging process.

3. **Stop Keylogger**: To stop the keylogger, click the "Stop Keylogger" button. You will be prompted to enter the admin password again for security purposes.

4. **View Captured Keystrokes**: The captured keystrokes will be saved to a file named `logs.txt` in the same directory as the program. You can open this file to view the recorded keystrokes.
